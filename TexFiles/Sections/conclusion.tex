\section{Conclusion}

In this analysis report, we found that over 90\% of Government of Canada 
departments have reported data in the service inventory over the past few years. 
These departments accept applications from Canadians through various services. 
For example, we identified the top and bottom 10 services based on the volume of 
applications received. Some of these applications were submitted online, while 
others were processed via telephone, in-person, email, and other channels. 
Although the number of services available entirely online remained low for 2022 
to 2023, we found that during challenging periods like the pandemic, the 
government effectively supported Canadians through online services. Finally, 
departments have been working diligently to provide services with standards and 
meet their targets. Performance levels peaked during 2022 to 2023, with 59.1\% 
of service standard targets being met.
