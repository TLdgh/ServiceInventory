Services can also be provided through different channels. Canadians can submit 
applications through telephone, online, in-person, postal mail, email, fax and 
other. Figure 4 illustrates the percentage distribution of applications submitted 
through each channel in recent years. Notably, during the pandemic from 2020 to 
2022, online applications counted for the majority of submissions, while 
in-person applications accounted for approximately one third both before and 
after this period. This pattern aligns with the return to normal service 
operations post-pandemic.
