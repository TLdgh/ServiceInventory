\section{Section 3}

Services can also be provided through different channels. Canadians can submit applications through telephone, online, 
in\_person, postal mail, email, fax and other. Figure 4 shows the percentage 
of applications submitted through each channel over the past few years. One 
can find the overall trend of the number of applications that can be done 
online for each type of channel during the past few years. During the Pandemic 
from 2020 to 2022, online applications count for most of the volumes, whereas 
in\_person applications count for about one third of the volumes before and 
after the Pandemic. This is expected as the service activities resumed to 
normal after the pandemic.
