The Service Inventory dataset contains 81 unique departments that offer 1637 
services from 2018 to 2023. However, not every department reports data in the 
service inventory. The number changes during different periods. Overall, one 
can see an increasing trend in the numbers. Over the past few years, more than 
90\% of the departments submitted their data to Service Inventory.
