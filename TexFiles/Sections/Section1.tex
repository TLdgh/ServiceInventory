The Service Inventory dataset contains 81 unique departments that offer 1637 
services from 2018 to 2023. In particular, more than 90\% of the departments 
submitted their data to Service Inventory. However, not all departments 
consistently report their data in the Service Inventory, leading to fluctuations 
over different periods. Despite this variability, there is a clear overall 
increasing trend in the number of services reported.
